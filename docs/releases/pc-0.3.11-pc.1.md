**WSword for PC (Windows 10/11, 64-bit)**, still built on **[Savage Wind Recomp](https://github.com/Revivedx/SavageWindRecomp) 0.4.1-alpha.4** (MIT). This update fixes NVIDIA DLSS frame generation.

No game files are included. You need your own dump of *Breath of the Wild* **1.9.0** (recommended) or 1.8.2.

### Fixed: WSword closed at start with NVIDIA DLSS frame generation on

With Settings > Video > Frame generation on **NVIDIA DLSS**, WSword closed a few seconds after starting, every time: WSword found the graphics card in a way NVIDIA's Streamline didn't see, so Streamline started without it and crashed. It now goes through Streamline.

If DLSS or its frame generation seem to do nothing, check that `nvngx_dlss.dll` is next to `WSword.exe` and `nvngx_dlssg.dll` is in the `streamline` folder (the start screen's Settings > Files puts them there).

### Updating

Unzip `WSword-0.3.11-pc.1-windows.zip` **over your WSword folder** and replace the files, `wsword_dlss.dll` included.
- **From 0.3.0-pc.1 or later:** your game files, game code, saves, settings, mods, `nvngx_dlss.dll` and `streamline\nvngx_dlssg.dll` stay as they are.
- **From 0.2.8-pc.x:** as 0.3.0-pc.1 describes - it finds your game files and saves, builds the game code once, and starts.

The full guide is in the zip (`WSword-PC-guide.md`).

### Licences

- `wsword_dlss.dll` is WSword's bridge to NVIDIA's DLSS SDK (under the SDK's licence: `NVIDIA-DLSS-LICENSE.txt`), to NVIDIA's Streamline SDK, and to ReShade (its add-on API headers, BSD-3-Clause: `ReShade-API-LICENSE.md`).
- The `streamline` folder holds NVIDIA's Streamline: its signed DLLs, and its licence. NVIDIA, RTX, DLSS and Reflex are NVIDIA's trademarks. WSword isn't made by or affiliated with NVIDIA.
